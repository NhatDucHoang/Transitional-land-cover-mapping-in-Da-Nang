Abstract
Da Nang city has currently experiencing rapid land use transitions as a result of urban expansion and infrastructure development. 
This study proposes an advanced framework integrating machine learning, remote sensing, and statistical analysis to evaluate the transitional land cover in 2024. 
Random forest model coupled with Sentinel-2 remote sensing data is used to recognize transitional land cover. 
Herein, the land cover in the study area is classified into two categories: “stable land cover” and “transitional land cover.” 
Labeling is performed using Sentinel‑2 imagery, with supplementary interpretation from Google Earth Pro. 
The machine learning model achieves satisfactory classification performance, with an accuracy of 87% and an F1 score of 0.87. 
Subsequently, statistical analyses are employed to reveal insights into the spatial distribution and characteristics of the transitional land cover in the study area. 
The spatial features of distance to coastlines, distance to industrial zones, distance to roads, and distance to rivers are used to quantify infrastructure and environmental
influences on the spatial distribution of the variable of interest. The logistic regression analysis indicates that distance to roads is the most influential factor. 
Spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed a highly significant and positive spatial clustering of transitional land cover, with recognizable clusters across districts.
These clusters align with major infrastructure developments and current status of urban development in the study area.
The findings of this study can be useful for supporting urban management and land use monitoring in Da Nang.
Keywords: urban planning; transitional land cover; machine learning; remote sensing; statistical analysis.
